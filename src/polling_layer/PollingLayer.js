/**

 *  updates, but that can be far more complicated than is required for a small
 *  application.

 * 
 *    action: Callback to run after each waiting interval

 *  !!! BEWARE using this module WITHOUT polling_time set to a reasonable millisecond
 *  amount can cause the browser to refresh infinitely. Do not leave the
